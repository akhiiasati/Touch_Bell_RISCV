# Touch_Sensor_Based_Bell_RISCV

## Introduction

The Touch Bell is a simple and interactive project that uses the TTP223 capacitive touch sensor and RISCV based processor to create a touch-activated bell. When a user touches the sensor, it triggers a bell sound, making it a fun and engaging way to call for attention or alert someone.

## TTP223 Capacitive Touch Sensor Switch

The TTP223 Capacitive Touch Sensor Switch is a touch-sensitive sensor module that uses capacitive touch technology to detect when it is touched or approached by a conductive object, such as a human finger. This type of sensor is widely used in various electronic applications for creating touch-sensitive interfaces or switches.

Here are some key features and characteristics of the TTP223 Capacitive Touch Sensor Switch:

- Touch Sensing: The TTP223 sensor can detect touch without any physical pressure. When a conductive object (like a finger) comes close to or makes contact with the sensor pad, it triggers a response.

- Digital Output: It provides a digital output, typically in the form of a HIGH (logic 1) or LOW (logic 0) signal, indicating whether a touch has been detected or not.

- Simple Interface: It's easy to interface with microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or other digital circuits. You usually connect the sensor's output pin to a digital input pin on your microcontroller.

- Low Power: The TTP223 sensor is designed to be energy-efficient, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.

- Sensitivity Adjustment: Some TTP223 modules may allow you to adjust the sensitivity of the touch detection, allowing you to fine-tune the response based on your requirements.

- Applications: It can be used in a wide range of applications, including touch-sensitive buttons, switches, interactive displays, proximity sensors, and more.

- Variants: There are different variants of the TTP223 sensor with varying features and pin configurations. The TTP223-BA6 is a common variant that provides a single touch-sensitive pad.

- Operating Voltage: TTP223 sensors typically operate at 3.3V or 5V, depending on the model and manufacturer.

- Reliability: Capacitive touch sensors like the TTP223 are known for their reliability and durability, as they have no moving parts and are not subject to wear and tear.

- Cost-Effective: These sensors are generally cost-effective and readily available, making them a popular choice for hobbyists and engineers.

The TTP223 Capacitive Touch Sensor Switch is frequently used in DIY electronics projects, including touch-sensitive lamps, touch-controlled appliances, interactive art installations, and more. It provides an intuitive and convenient way to interact with devices and interfaces without the need for physical buttons or switches.

## Working Mechanism of TTP223 Capacitive Touch Sensor

Capacitive screens do not use the pressure of your finger to create a change in the flow of electricity. Instead, they work with anything that holds an electrical charge â€“ including human skin.

When a finger hits the screen a tiny electrical charge is transferred to the finger to complete the circuit, creating a voltage drop on that point of the screen. The software processes the location of this voltage drop and orders the ensuing action.

## Gate Level Simulation:

The gate-level synthesis (GLS) process involves converting a behavioral or RTL (Register Transfer Level) description of a digital design into a gate-level netlist using a library of standard cells. This netlist represents the design using specific gates such as AND, OR, NOT, and flip-flops, as defined by the technology library being used.

Here are the steps involved in the gate-level synthesis process and the subsequent gate-level simulation using GTKWave:

1. Reading the Library:

```bash
read_liberty -lib sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib
```

This command reads the technology library that includes the information about the standard cells available in the target technology.

2. Reading the Verilog Files:
```bash
read_verilog processor.v
```
This command reads the Verilog files that describe the processor's design.

3. Synthesis:
```bash
synth -top wrapper
```
This command initiates the synthesis process, generating a gate-level netlist based on the specified top-level module.

4. Mapping Flip-Flops:

```bash
dfflibmap -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib
```
This command maps the flip-flops in the design to specific D flip-flops from the technology library.

5. ABC (Advanced Boolean Calculator) Synthesis:

```bash
abc -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib
```

This command performs technology mapping and optimization of the synthesized netlist.

6. Writing the Gate-Level Verilog Netlist:

```bash
write_verilog <filename.v>
```
This command writes the gate-level Verilog netlist to a specified file.

7. Gate-Level Simulation:

```bash
iverilog -o test testbench.v glstest.v sky130_sram_1kbyte_1rw1r_32x256_8.v sky130_fd_sc_hd.v primitives.v
```

This command compiles the Verilog testbench and design files along with the necessary libraries and primitive modules.

8. Viewing Waveforms:

The resulting simulation is then visualized using GTKWave, which allows you to view the waveforms of signals in the design to verify the functionality of the synthesized netlist.
